Cinder - TextureSequence
===========

Utility class for [Cinder v0.9.0](https://libcinder.org/) used to play through a sequence of textures or other objects.
This new version is templated to make it easier to animate any kind of classes, such as 3D meshes. It includes a helper class to automate the loading of multiple files from a folder.

Includes 2 samples and a tool to trim the unused space of an image sequence in order the reduce loading time. This is still a work in progress.

Tested only on Mac OS X but should work in other platforms.
